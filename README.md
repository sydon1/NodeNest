This is a an Android application developed in Java with Android Studio for my second year course "Programming Techniques" at KU Leuven - Group T.  
Grade: 15/20

## Overview
NodeNest, an Android application serves as an mobile IoT device manager. It allows users to monitor and control connected IoT devices from their Android smartphones. 
This IoT device manager app was developed as a learning project to teach programming techniques and concepts. Thus we followed the Model - View - Controller design pattern while designing the application. 

## Features: 
  - Integrating the MQTT protocol for IoT communication
  - Real time sensor data visualization
  - Login & Account creation
  - Device control using MQTT messages

## Notes: 
We did not include any details regarding our MQTT broker and how we approached this part of the application. However there are many ways to go about this, as you could self host an MQTT broker, use a cloud based service or use a public broker.
