This is a an Android application developed in Java with Android Studio my second year course "Programming Techniques" at KU Leuven - Group T. 
Grade: 15/20

## Overview
NodeNest, an Android application serves as an mobile IoT device manager. It allows users to monitor and control connected IoT devices from their Android smartphones. 
This IoT device manager app was developed as a learning project to teach programming techniques and concepts. Thus we followed the Model - View - Controller design pattern while designing the application. 
The app can monitor actual IoT devices because the MQTT protocol was implemented for real-time communication with sensors and other devices.
